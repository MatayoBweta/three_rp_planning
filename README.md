</p>

<p style="‘text-align:justify’">

Data coordination is the process of organizing, managing, and distributing data so that it is accurate, consistent, and usable. Effective data coordination is necessary for ensuring that data is accessible, dependable, and valuable and for allowing businesses to maximize their data assets.

</p>

<p style="‘text-align:justify’">

This platform provides various crucial data coordination pieces, including:

</p>

<ul>


<li style=‘text-align: justify;’><strong>Data governance</strong>: This involves establishing policies, procedures, and standards for managing data, including who has access to it and how it can be used. The governance is driven by 3RP guidance and is integrated into the tool steps to implement.</li>

<li style=‘text-align: justify;’><strong>Data management</strong>: This includes storing, organizing, and protecting data, as well as ensuring that it is accurate, consistent, and up to date. An embedded data quality module ensures that the appropriate stakeholders know and address the data quality issues promptly.</li>

<li style=‘text-align: justify;’><strong>Data sharing</strong>: It involves making data available to authorized users within an organization or beyond, including using data portals or other tools. The system allows downloading the data in excel format and sharing it with other stakeholders.</li>

<li style=‘text-align: justify;’><strong>Data integration</strong>: This involves combining data from different sources, systems, or formats to create a single, cohesive view of the data. All the data produced in the system will be directly registered in Activity Info, and that can facilitate the follow-up and ensure that the data is well integrated with existing systems in place for planning and monitoring.</li>

</ul>

<p style="‘text-align:justify’">

Data coordination is essential because it helps organizations use and leverage their data assets effectively and make informed, data-driven decisions.

# Important Data

## Master Data Managed using Activity Info:

Master data relevant to the 3RP planning and monitoring will be accessible throughout all planning and monitoring stages. Reviewing this data during the planning phase and ensuring that it aligns with the established goals for the upcoming year is essential. The result of that review is stored in Activity Info and supports the capture of planning data.

**Outputs**: In the theory of change, the output refers to the specific, measurable actions or changes that occur because of a program or intervention. These outputs are usually intermediate steps that lead to the desired long-term outcome or impact. For example, an educational program designed to improve literacy rates among students may have outputs such as an increased number of students attending classes, improved reading scores on standardized tests, and increased availability of reading materials.

The following fields are relevant to capture for each output :
- **Regional Strategic Direction**: The overarching strategy for providing humanitarian assistance in a specific region; in our case, it is the MENA region. This can include goals and objectives for addressing humanitarian and development needs and strategies for coordinating and delivering aid.
- **Country Strategic Direction**: The strategy for providing humanitarian assistance in a specific country. This can include goals and objectives for addressing humanitarian needs and strategies for coordinating and delivering aid.
- **Inter-Sectoral Outcome**: A desired outcome spans multiple sectors, such as improving access to essential services or reducing vulnerability.
- **Sector**: The specific sector or area of focus within the humanitarian and development field to which the output is related, such as health, education, or protection.
- **Objective**: The specific objective that the output is intended to achieve, such as increasing the number of people with access to clean water.
- **Output**: The tangible and measurable result expected to be produced by a particular activity or series of activities, such as the number of people reached with a particular service or the number of households provided with shelter.
- **Output Code**: A numerical or alphanumerical code assigned to a specific output can be used to identify and organize information related to that output.
- **Output Key**: A unique identifier for the output containing the code and the output.
3RP: Telling of it is a 3RP output or not.

**Organizations**: Having a master list of organizations in a coordination setup is essential for several reasons:
1.	**Clarity and Efficiency**: A master list of organizations can provide a clear and comprehensive overview of all the stakeholders involved in a project or initiative. This can help streamline communication and collaboration among different groups.
2.	**Accountability**: A master list can help ensure that all parties know their roles and responsibilities and can help hold organizations accountable for their actions.
3.	**Coordination**: A master list can help with coordination efforts by identifying overlaps and gaps in the activities of different organizations and facilitating communication and collaboration among them.
4.	**Representation**: The master list ensures that all the necessary organizations and stakeholders are represented in the coordination setup and that no one is left out. This helps in making the project inclusive and equitable.
5.	**Record-keeping and monitoring**: Having a master list of organizations can also help with record-keeping and monitoring the initiative's progress by providing a clear and consistent reference point.

**Indicators**: Keeping a master list of indicators is essential for coordination because it:
1.	**Facilitates communication and coordination**: A master list of indicators can help different organizations and stakeholders understand and align their efforts. It allows everyone to track progress and identify potential overlaps or gaps in their activities.
2.	**Enhances consistency and comparability**: Having a master list of indicators ensures that all parties use the same definitions and measurement methods, enabling comparison of results and evaluation of the overall impact.
3.	**Allows for better monitoring and reporting**: A master list of indicators can be used to establish a monitoring and reporting framework. This makes collecting data, tracking progress, and reporting on the initiative's outcomes easier.
4.	**Makes data management easier**: A master list of indicators provides a unified approach to data collection and management, allowing for easy access and data analysis, helping to gain insight and make data-driven decisions.

**Sectors**: The refugee coordination model identifies the leading sectors for addressing the needs of refugees and other displaced persons; these sectors are the core components of a comprehensive response to a displacement crisis and are each designed to address specific needs that arise because of displacement. These sectors are important because they are the basics that should be provided in an emergency so that they can make a significant difference in the lives of refugees and displaced persons. Focusing on these areas can prevent the spread of disease, improve living conditions, and contribute to overall well-being.

The fields help to provide a clear and organized understanding of the activities and resources that are associated with that sector.

- 	**Code Name**: A unique identifier and the name given to a specific sector or area of focus within the humanitarian field. 
- **Code**: A numerical or alphanumerical code assigned to a specific sector can be used to identify and organize information related to that sector.
- **Sector Number**: An number assigned to a specific sector can be used to identify and organize information related to that sector.
- **Language**: The language in which the sector's information is primarily presented.
- **Name**: The full name or title of the sector.
- **Short Name**: A shortened version of the sector's name can be used for brevity in communications and documentation.
- **3RP Name**: The sector's name in the context of the "3RP Response Plan" (3RP), which is a coordinated plan for providing humanitarian assistance in a specific crisis or region.
- **Lead Organization**: The primary organization responsible for coordinating and leading activities within the sector.
- **Co-Lead Organization**: An additional organization that may also lead in coordinating and leading activities within the sector.
- **Access Token**: A string of characters used to authenticate and authorize access to information related to the sector.
- **Color**: A color code or hex code associated with the sector can be used to color-code information or materials related to the sector.
- **3RP Color**: The color used to represent the sector in visualizations related to the 3RP
- **3RP**: Saying if the sector is a 3RP sector or not.
- **Service**: Telling if the sector is supporting the provision of a set of services.
- **Effective Sector**: Telling the sector is an effective sector or a set of sectors brought together to support a working group definition.
- **Active**: A term indicating if the sector is currently active or not.

## Planning Data relevant to the 3RP planning

The data collected will be crucial for the planning phase of the 3RP (Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan), providing vital information necessary to make informed decisions and design effective and targeted interventions. Planning data support identifying the needs and priorities of the affected population, determining the resources required, and setting realistic goals and objectives. The set of indicators and outputs defined during the planning stage will also help to monitor progress towards these goals and to adjust as necessary to ensure that assistance is reaching those who need it most.

During the monitoring phase, the data will support the evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of the interventions, the identification of any gaps or shortcomings, and inform the implementation of any corrective measures that may be necessary. This will ensure that assistance reaches the intended beneficiaries, that resources are being used effectively, and that the overall response is on track to meet the established goals.

**Timeline**:  The 3RP planning phases involve essential steps outlined in the steps form. These steps include the preselection of sectors, identification of existing donors, and budgeting for specific outputs for the current year. The next step involves providing information on the existing budget, budget requirements, and targets for indicators.

**Budget requirements**: The form aids in collecting and compiling the total budgetary requirements of appealing organizations by sector and intervention outputs. The 3RP is a platform for fundraising appeals, providing prospective donors with information on the needs of the impacted population and securing the financial resources required to conduct a humanitarian or development response. Depending on the exact circumstances and demands of the crisis or disaster and the project's size and breadth, the budget required for a humanitarian effort might vary significantly. However, a budget for a humanitarian initiative often includes many standard components:
1.	**Personnel costs**: This includes the salaries and benefits of staff members involved in the project, such as project managers, coordinators, and field staff.
2.	**Program costs**: These are the costs associated with the specific activities and interventions of the project, such as the distribution of food aid, the construction of shelters, or the provision of medical care.
3.	**Overhead costs**: These are the costs of running the project, such as office rent, utilities, communication costs, transportation, and logistics.
4.	**Monitoring and evaluation costs**: These are associated with monitoring and evaluating the project, such as conducting assessments and evaluations, data collection and analysis, and reporting.
5.	**Contingency costs**: These are the additional funds set aside to cover unexpected costs or changes in the project.
6.	**Sustainability and transition costs**: These are the costs associated with planning the sustainability and transition of the project's outcomes and ensuring the project's activities and interventions don't have adverse effects after the project ends.

**Existing Budget**: In humanitarian and development contexts, a carry-over budget refers to funds that were allocated for specific programs or projects but were not fully utilized in the current fiscal year due to factors such as logistical difficulties, modifications to the project's scope, or delays in implementation. These monies are carried over to the next fiscal year and may be utilized to continue or extend the original project. In the humanitarian and development context, multi-year budgeting refers to the planning and budgeting process that spans many years and is often tied to the financing cycles of significant contributors. This approach assists in aligning humanitarian and development programs with the long-term vision and strategic goals of the organizations and communities they serve. This strategy enables companies to plan better, organize, and assess their effect over an extended period. It also aids in the continuation of programs and initiatives by maintaining the continuity of financing and preventing interruptions in the delivery of assistance and services, which is crucial in times of crisis or disaster.

**Indicators Target**: An indicator is a measurable and quantifiable characteristic that provides information about a particular aspect of a program or project. Indicators are used to track progress, evaluate results, and make decisions about program implementation. They are generally designed to measure specific aspects of a program or project, such as the number of people reached, changes in knowledge or behavior, or changes in a particular condition or situation. The main reasons for providing targets for indicators include the following:
1.	**Measuring progress**: Setting targets for indicators allows organizations to measure progress toward achieving their overall goals and objectives.
2.	**Prioritization**: Setting targets helps organizations prioritize their activities and allocate resources effectively.
3.	**Accountability**: Having targets and indicators in place allows organizations to be accountable to their stakeholders, including donors, communities, and beneficiaries, by providing a means to track progress and evaluate results.
4.	**Goal alignment**: Targets help align the activities of different stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, and civil society, to a standard set of goals and objectives.
5.	**Evidence-based decision-making**: Targets and indicators provide a way to collect and analyze data, which can inform decision-making and adapt program strategies as needed.
6.	**Communication and advocacy**: Targets and indicators can be used to communicate the progress and results of programs to a broader audience and advocate for increased funding and support.
7.	**Continuous improvement**: targets help to identify the gaps, track the progress and improve the program performance over time.
